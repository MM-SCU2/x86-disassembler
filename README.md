# x86 DISSASSEMBLER

## INTENTION OF THE PROJECT 

	The project was born out of the passion for system programming and compilers. The idea was to produce a simple disassembler
	capable of turning machine code back into ASM. Originally it was not planned to give support to 64 bits instructions but due 
	to them not being very different from 32 bits instructions, the support may be added on the future.
	Another reason to do this is beacuse I wanted to provide an implementation as an example for such a thing 
	that wasn't too complicated to understand or insanely large, 
	as for example the "objdump" utility of GNU whose source code can be found but due to its size 
	it turns out to be very complicated to use it as a guide.

	I hope it may be usefull for those of you that are interested in these topics.



## Disclaimer

	There is unfinished work yet to be done, i lack the time to fulfil everything right now 
	but i hope that the work that is done up to this point is enough to guide those of you that are interested in building
	your own tools for binary manipulation and system programming.
